# Beginner Python Projects 🐍

This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects I’m building to strengthen my coding foundation.  
Each project focuses on applying core Python concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and string operations.  
I’ll keep adding more projects as I learn and grow 🚀.

- Demonstrates input handling, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

### 2. Palindrome Checker 🔄
- Checks if a word is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
- Case insensitive, so `"Madam"` and `"madam"` are both palindromes.
